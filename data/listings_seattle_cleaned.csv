My life motto, stay in the moment and appreciate each moment for what that moment brings.   Each person who stays at my home, gives me an opportunity to connect more with the world around me.

We are young, energetic, adventurous, easy going and polite.  We are excited to be traveling to Europe this summer for the first time and crave to experience all that we can while here.  

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels, if you are curious or would like to know more about us, Please Please ask us, we are more than willing to share!

I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand.

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home.

After having used Airbnb as a guest and meeting so many interesting people, I am now looking forward to hosting guests in my home. Your actual host will be Lydia, who is a Seattle native and young professional helping me with the hosting. Depending upon your needs, she would have many great suggestions to help you enjoy your stay in Seattle!

*From Lydia, in my own words: I am a travel enthusiast and dance addict. Meeting people from varying backgrounds and countries fulfills me more than anything! Having lived in several countries, I find it vital to live through first-hand experience. I hope to be a humble, compassionate and vibrant host with your stay at The Gallery.

919364,Jeff,2011-08-04,"Berkeley, California, United States","I studied Neuroscience and Psychology at UC Berkeley and went on to found Merlock L.L.C

I've traveled extensively to England, Germany, France, Italy, India, Thailand, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico, Hawaii, Ukraine, and Israel.

Merlock L.L.C. is a web hosting and I.T. consulting business that builds customized software for businesses to enhance productivity. We are also innovators of green energy equipment such as devices that recycle used cooking oil into cost effective vehicle fuel.

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. I believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status. 

While in college I owned a company that produced raves and concerts near San Francisco. While I don't produce raves anymore, I still run (website hidden) on the side, which sells music. 

I joke around a lot and act like a kid when I'm around cute little pets. I love plants and growing plants. If I get an avocado (yum!) I plant the seed. 

One indicator of successful people is their ability to choose a greater reward that takes longer to achieve, versus an inferior reward that takes less time. I typically wait the longer period for the greater reward.

We  discovered vacation apartment living some years ago in Paris, in the Marais, totally immersed in the neighborhood, no tourists around.  I will never stay in a hotel again, if I can help it. Living where the locals live and to interact with them is a huge part of the experience.  

I was born in Germany and came to California when I was very young.  You might say that I came on a whim, with hardly an idea what I was getting into.  But it all worked out beautifully.   
Renting to vacationers has always been a dream, one might say, it has been on the ""bucket list.""  I rent out a room in my own house and have met so many wonderful people, mostly from countries other than the USA.

My Airbnb in Seatle is a sort of branching out.  It will be a place for us to stay when we will visit our daughter, who moved here after college.  In the meantime, it is a side job for her.

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too.

Seattle, Washington, USA                   Member since October 2013.

Thanks for checking us out for your visit to Seattle. We would like to be your local hosts while you are here.

Barbara is a native of Austria and speaks German as well as English.  Michael is from Miami and speaks Spanish, Portuguese and some Italian.  We both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. In 1980, we chose Seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on Queen Anne. 

Now that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. 

These include cooking (inspired by Barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating Seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. 

We are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). In addition, Barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.

Michael is involved in the growing ""movement for health"" scene. He is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.

Last but not least is Sammy, our 5 year old beagle. He is friendly and adorable. He helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on Queen Anne. And he
doesn't bark or bay!!!

I'm an outgoing person, love the outdoors, hiking etc. I have a golden retriever so if you don't like dogs you might want to stay elsewhere. I'm friendly, easy-going and like meeting new people! In addition to the private bed/bathroom, the rest of my house is open to you except my bedroom and office. Occasionally I also rent the entire home out when away on business or pleasure trips.  Feel free to store groceries if need be, use washer/dryer/iron board, I want you to feel like you're at home!

What I look for/expect from travelers as a host: All I ask is whenever you're in the common areas like kitchen etc, please cleanup after yourselves and respect the house like your own. As for your room, I take care of that and do a thorough cleaning of all towels, loofahs, wash cloths etc. vacuum, change/wash sheets and clean bathroom just like a hotel does prior to arrival of every booked guest.

** Most travelers that come through have their own agendas and are not around too much, However in the event a guest is hanging around looking for stuff to do--i will gladly help and share popular tourist and ""local"" cool places to check out. However, I don't want to feel obligated to entertain guests because I have my own life as well--errands, plans w/ friends etc. 

Where I have Traveled: I've been to Europe, Africa, Argentina, Aruba, Jamaica, and most everywhere in the U.S. !

Hi everybody, I’m Jerome and I’ll be your Host. When I’m not working on home improvement projects, I focus my thoughts on things that don’t exist, but could make life and the world better if they did. Some thoughts have matured and become issued patents, while others have kinks yet to be worked out. I record lots of my projects on video for my jeromegipson YouTube Chanel, which have received over a half million views.
I had a lot of allergies when I was young and found that I had to give up eating sugars, dairy, meat, and alcohols, but I haven’t been sick or even had a cold in over 30 years, and I wouldn’t trade my health for anything.

My wife and I operate a new tourist rental company called Lake Sammamish Rentals and we do all of the residential bookings through AirBnB.  We are new to AirBnB but we’re not new to the rental business.  In fact, we’ve been doing it longer than AirBnB.  If you ever rented a private RV in San Diego you probably rented it from us, or at least ran across our business.  In fact, if you go to YouTube and search for “ComeGetMyRV Fox 5 News” you can see the news segment as well as other customer testimonials about the quality of rental service we’ve been providing since 2006.  But before you ask, and start planning an RV road trip to San Diego we sold the RV business, moved to WA, used our prior experience from that business and now have rental properties in Seattle and Sammamish. 

The Sammamish lake view property is located on the ""East Side,"" an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the Seattle property is on the ""West Side"" in a suburb next to downtown Seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.  While that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some, it was a long way of telling you that even though we don’t have a lot of reviews on AirBnB, we are trustworthy, experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that you’ll have the best stay possible.

Most of the time I will be traveling with my wife Flavia. We have a chihuahua named Francisco (he sometimes travels with us!)

We love to travel. We have taken the train from Oslo to Bergen, the train from Berlin to Prague. We have also been in Italy, Amsterdam, Mexico and we recently drove across the United States from Florida to Seattle, making as many stops as we could.   We enjoy sightseeing, hiking, scuba dive if possible. We also enjoy a good meal and tasting local delicacies.

In our free time we enjoy cooking, listening to music, enjoy art and design.

One of our favorite places ever is Dos Ojos in the Yucatan Peninsula. If you scuba dive, I recommend you doing the cave diving, it's an amazing experience. If you don't scuba, you can still enjoy the clear and fresh water that the cenote has. Another amazing place is the Bioluminescent lagoon in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Our third favorite is the 7 hour train ride from Oslo to Bergen in Norway, spectacular views of the Fjords.

We travel light. We are very quiet people, we don't smoke and don't watch TV. We will spend most of our time exploring the surroundings and spend our time in the apartments just to rest and prepare for our days.

661691,Katy,2011-06-03,"Vancouver, Washington, United States","I rent out my WorldMark timeshare -- 120+ resort locations all over the US, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and England.

My specialty is last-minute short-stay accommodations, but please be smart about your expectations: if it's less than a month before any kind of holiday, concert, or event, it's likely already booked up. Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. 

You can book as far as 13 months out.

*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.

If you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)

I have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.

Almost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.

Sadly, the resorts do not allow pets.

Wifi is $4.95/day or $15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.

This is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)

We've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.

The five things I can't live without?
Good quality coffee
Poetry
Music
Stimulating conversation
My greyhound Rae

My hosting style? 
Flexible. I want my guests to have the experience they are hoping for. If you want a quiet haven, you'll have it. You can be as independent and have as much alone time as you like. But if you want to have coffee with me in the morning, or watch a movie, or walk down to the beach with me and my dog to get some exercise and see the beautiful Puget sound - I like that too.

I used to read and (try to) speak French and German. If you speak either of these feel free to try it out on me, but go slow and be patient!

As a guest?
If I'm travelling for enjoyment, I like getting to meet and interact with my host a little bit. I want the chance to meet new people and discover how they live and what their neighborhoods are like. 
If I'm traveling for business, I will probably want a quiet and organized place to come back to and rejuvenate after a day of hard work.

Do I have a life motto?
I haven't decided on just one yet. But here are two I love:

John Steinbeck:
""A kind of light spread out from her.
And everything changed color.
And the world opened.

And a day was good to awaken to,
And there were no limits to anything,
And the people of the world were good, and handsome.""

These days I'm a realtime captioner for hard of hearing.  Which means I go to classes, meetings, conferences with students (or staff or faculty) primarily at the University of Washington and write live everything being said so the student can read it on my computer screen as it's happening.  You've seen closed captioning on TV?  It's like that, only I'm there live on site.  Love my job.  It's challenging (that is to say, hard) and can be stressful, but I am glad to be a vehicle for access to education and the workplace that people wouldn't have without that service.

Friends who know me know that I love being a steward to houses, even working by day for a house moving company where we save full-sized Craftsman-style homes by physically *moving* them from one place to another (by land or by barge). Nickel Bros house moves have been featured on Home & Garden TV's shows ""Haulin' House,"" and on Discovery and National Geographic Channels' ""Monster Moves.""

My goal is to make your stay at the ""Architect's Gem"" one of the best you've ever had!

— Jeff

About Owners: Brandon & Shanna

A family of Architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. We started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing Green homes and Live/Work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the Seattle area. We are proud to have contributed to the built-space of Seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home — which you can now enjoy.

Why West Seattle:

We *love* our West Seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. The house itself is a classic 1917 Bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. We were drawn to West Seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that West Seattle has to offer: Admiral District (where we are); Alki Beach (must-see); Alaska Junction (the main urban core); Morgan Junction (great pub and restaurants); Fauntleroy/Endolyne (Ferry to Vashon and Peninsula, great restaurants); Westwood Village (convenient 'town centre' mall). We think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!

The Unique Benefits at this House:
 
Our home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. We've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. Fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. Walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to Alki Beach for a nice Mexican meal at Cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. During the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in Seattle. Visit Salty's restaurant on Harbor Avenue overlooking the Seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the Elliott Bay. Or, if you want to tour the Pike Place Market by day or enjoy the Seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown! Take a longer ride out to Snoqualmie Pass for skiing during the winter, or hike, climb, kayak, or sail your way through the summer months in the greater Seattle area.

Our goal when traveling was to ""live like a local""--shop at the local markets, walk to nearby cafes, restaurants, catch a local live show, and enjoy the nature at each destination we visited. 

When we built our dream home, we immediately knew we had to allocate a space that would become a future Beach escape for others to enjoy.  We find ourselves enjoying every minute of hosting & one of our favorite aspects of being an AIRBNB host is the ability to meet colorful people from all corners of the world, helping them get acquainted with our community. It's because of our past travels through AIRBNB that piqued our love for hosting and sharing the local living of West Seattle & Alki-- we can't wait to welcome you to our little Beach oasis!

Hi I'm Chelsi here is a little bit about me: 

Quotes that I like: 
""Attack life, it kills you anyways""
""True measure of your character is what you're willing to do when others aren't looking"" 

I love to read. I don't make enough time to read though. I'm at the beach, which is right down the street, as often as I can. 
I love to write, draw, paint and doing artistic things. Interior design is expensive so I love to bargain shop and reclaim vintage items or steal a deal at a funky thrift store. 

You'll find the interior design at this place is an eclectic piece of living art. Each piece has a historical story and most are Cannabis, Music, Sci-Fi, or Seattle related. I am cannabis friendly! I work in the cannabis industry. (Chef Jeremy Cooper has decorated the B&B in an amazing way. He used history, art, music, and Cannabis to create an environment that makes you feel like Cannabis was never illegal.) 

5 Things I can't live without:

The freedom to be me. (I love to play soccer, just before going pro I injured myself)  
Good People (In warm places helps) 
A sustainable future!
Hope (For a better tomorrow) 
Food & Water (If its good that's great. If its great ohhhhhh my Dog!)

I love to travel! When I'm not traveling, I want to talk to people with stories of there travels. That's why I love doing the B&B. I love taking care of people and giving them the hospitality we all deserve. 

I travel in style, simple, but comfortable, always looking for that next adventure, that little bit of something that gives my mind an opportunity to open more and more. 

I hope you will join us for an experience in Seattle's Hospitality driven Cannabis B&B.

Stay in simple luxury, and enjoy an uplifting, educational, delicious, Canna-cation.

My chihuahua Annabelle is usually by my side, and is very good at finding sun spots whenever they appear (this is Seattle, yes, but they do appear!).  I'm amazed by how many new restaurants and bars have opened in the last couple of years, and like to try new spots whenever possible; having said that, as a vegan I do have my favorites.  I have an art background and enjoy visiting the SAM, and also like to bob my head with the rest of the crowd at many of Seattle's many music venues. I volunteer at the local animal shelter, am a huge fan of innovative design, and sometimes can be found on a yoga mat.  
 
If you're looking for things to do while you are in town, here are a few suggestions:

Favorite Thai place: Jai Thai in Fremont
Favorite breakfast spot: SunLight Cafe on Roosevelt and 65th
Favorite New-Agey store: East-West book store 
Best Theater for independent films: Guild 45 theater in Wallingford
Favorite music venue: Showbox at the Market
Favorite neighborhood for lively night-life: Capitol Hill
Favorite yoga studio: 8 Limbs
Favorite hiking area for moderate hiking: Darrington, North Cascades.  (Try Boulder River for a scenic drive and nice day hike).
Favorite challenging hike: Mount Pilchuck

I studied Interior Design at Parson's in New York and Bruce joined me one summer for classes at Parson's in Paris.  We are both passionate for design and love the comfortable relaxed and ever so creative philosophy of French design.
We have always loved sharing our art filled home with friends from near and far and offering a relaxing refuge within the city.  When we ended up with an empty nest it seemed a natural fit to share our spacious home with travelers like you. I was a business traveler years ago as a rep for several high end appliance lines, and would have loved a home atmosphere to kick back after a day on the road.  
We love puttering in the kitchen and trying new recipes, so you might get to be a bonafide taster if you hang out with us.  We love gardening but we also love our American Brittany dog Roc, so the garden can at times show signs of a dog.
I have listed languages we speak and although I am by no means fluent in any but English, we can stutter through and manage to communicate in French, Spanish and German.
Sharing Seattle's art and entertainment is always fun for us, so be sure to let us know what you might like to see, from Shakespeare in the Park, and free concerts at the Ballard Locks to Chihuly's Glass Garden, an entertaining night at Jazz Alley or how to get to one of the many sports events our city has to offer on the bus from our place.
We are very understanding hosts and know that you are in a new place and we are here to help you.  Although not part of our regular routine when you visit, if you have just flown in from half way around the world and at midnight you are starving with few options to find a restaurant serving, we can most certainly find something in our kitchen to get you through the night, from soup and sandwiches, to goodies in the refrigerator to warm up for a light supper or midnight breakfast.  We are always glad to help with direction and print out bus schedules or directions for you to take with you on your day of exploring.

******CHARACTER REFERENCES:  

“I have known Pina for 18 years since I first moved to Seattle, when she owned and operated Botticelli Caffe. 

As a frequent customer I was able to watch Pina run both the café and another Restaurant over the years. Pina was a tireless worker, sharing her time between the café, her daughter and all of her many friends made through the business. 

 The clientele was made up of regulars who came in for her great smile and great conversation. Tourists were always given sound advice and direct ions to all of the best Seattle sites.

I was able to work again with Pina on the purchase of my home where she was instrumental in finding the house my family enjoyed for several years along with all the close friends and neighbors Pina was able to introduce during our residence. Pina is always cheerful, dependable and tirelessly working to help those close to her.”  
                
S.B. - Interior Designer

 ******I was a tenant in an apartment building that Pina managed. From inquiring about the apartment, to leasing and maintenance, Pina proved herself to be friendly, responsive, and available. 

My husband and I felt comfortable and well supported while the building was under Pina's management. When a new manager started, there was an unfortunate and noticeable change in the sense of community within the building. 

After experiencing many other apartment managers, I rate Pina as tops. She was always professional, reasonable, and neighborly. I would be lucky to find another manager as caring as Pina.
B.S. - Transportation Consultant

******“I have known Pina  for 15 years as a wonderful friend, reliable apartment manager, prosperous business owner, a professional Realtor and a wonderfully committed mother.

I'm in senior product management at Microsoft, and if I want to make clear that Pina rates highly in all areas in my opinion - interpersonal communications skills, her attention to detail, her ability to socialize or work in a group in a charismatic and professional yet relaxed manner. She would be an asset to many and scores highly in my opinion”

I've spent the last 19 years lovingly restoring my 1909 classic Seattle home by blending the charm of a 106-yr old house with modern amenities. I've surrounded my home with a private garden that is an official backyard Wildlife Sanctuary as designated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife.

I love creating cool spaces using a minimalist approach. I've also remodeled the upstairs floor, which I use for my Acupuncture and Thai yoga massage office. I love when new and existing clients walk through the door, breathe a deep sigh, and say ""This place is amazing. Can I live here?!!""

When I'm not working and teaching workshops to other massage therapists, I'm spending time with my boyfriend and 17 yr-old son, in my garden, on my mt. bike, at the gym, doing research, making stuff with my hands, exploring the world, and being goofy.

Favorite places I've traveled include Bali, Laos, Nepal, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Thailand. I also love exploring the great Pacific Northwest and love playing in the woods on Whidbey Island. My short list for travel includes Austria, Iceland, Japan, Slovenia, and Vietnam.

I try to go back to Europe at least once a year. My roots there are still really strong, even though I find myself more and more falling in love with this crazy unique place that is the US.

I love to travel and visit different places. In the last few years I visited Mexico (quite a few times), Bali, Hong Kong, Dubai, Oman, Doha, Vietnam, and I can't wait to start planning my next big trip: Scandinavia!

Being a traveler myself, I believe I understand what a person is looking for when moving from point A to point B: comfort, good vibes, good locations, good transport options, and I believe that our space offers that in abundance. Of course, no place is perfect for everyone. In Italian we have a saying: La vita è bella perché è varia (Life is beautiful because it's varied). And I live by that. 

In 2014 I finally became a fully-fledged yoga teacher in the Anusara tradition. Although I practice regularly, I have not yet found a space (more a mental space than an actual studio) to teach. But I patiently wait. It will happen once it's time. In the meantime, I enjoy exploring different studios and traditions. Seattle has so much to offer when it comes to yoga. Ask me for tips!

We are small business owners and thought Airbnb would be an interesting new venture at a less stressful pace.  We are very casual after business hours :) and a very social couple.  We enjoy meeting people from different cultures and love to entertain.

Prez:  I have been blessed with opportunities to travel many places (or at least many places to us), love new experiences and seeing historic land marks. We take pride in our city's beauty, rich culture and past good or bad.

I've worked for myself most of my life and love being creative . I enjoy graphic design, acting rapping, video production, editing, directing, ballin' and shot callin' (a little urban humor) LOL. I truly want to do everything. I was a volunteer fire fighter with the Seattle Fire Department, EMT and certified life guard. ( I told you I want to do everything)

I have a lot of day activity and nightlife connections with the transportation company I manage, if you want to do a little exploring- we've got the hook up.  We like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun. (Warning it can get a little crazy with us, especially once the party bus gets rolling, lol ). It is very common to see buses coming or going from our property at various hours of the day and night.  You can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop off'(email hidden), please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.

We are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  Your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect. Our space has its own keyless entry so you're welcome to come and go as you please without worrying about disturbing the rest of the house. 

I hope to have you stay with us...check out our reviews and book a night!

I lived on Capitol Hill in a condo until moving to this house on North Beacon Hill in 2002.  This neighborhood is RELATIVELY close to downtown (but not IN downtown) and convenient for AirBnB guests with vehicle who are looking for a compromise between hostel and motel or else don't mind riding public transit or using UberX and Lyft to visit all the major tourist sights.

I spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. I am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and ""getting married"" to my house.  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a ""safe"" profile.  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results. I started hosting people in July 2014.  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. I don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as LOCATION - how does a host fix their Location? It's on the map!) or Value (did you not search other listings first? If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! They have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) If you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!  Bottom line: I offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb - you're just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.

If you are new to AirBnB please look up the internet article:

If you are considering becoming a host yourself, I recommend looking up AirBnB Horror Stories and AirbnB Rental Nightmares to understand the risk and liability involved in being one.

3118422,Julie,2012-07-31,"Seattle, Washington, United States","Here we go. I'll make myself sound extremely fun to be around.

Let me just say one thing first: I love pork. There's nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin, perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey, balsamic vinegar, and red wine sauce. I could eat pork breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

I'm from California, so I'm not a typical Northwestern person. I like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. I like saving the world and being green friendly, but I'm also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. 

I love to travel and experience new things. I'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (We may have that in common?) I'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since I'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. 

My life motto: Don't be an a-hole. And that is the truth. And be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.

People tell me I'm funny. It's true. I am funny. Someone told me I'm captivating the other day. That just makes me roll my eyes though.

I am a fanboy for Jurassic Park. It's my favorite movie, and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it! You can dislike numbers 2-4 though. I won't fault you that. Maybe just don't bring it up. ;)

I'm also a ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. MAYBE NOT.

My favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe. I grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. There is something particularly magnificent about its smell. Pine trees are my favorite. You might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. I love trees.

Places I've traveled to: Caribbean, France, Spain, Italy, Monaco, Israel, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, Grand Canyon, Chicago, Boston, Vancouver, BC, Portland, OR, Ukraine, Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand. My next trips are Iceland and South Africa! I'm visiting a past airbnb guest. I CAN'T WAIT!

Places I've lived: Sacramento area, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Seattle, WA.

I don't have five things I can't live without. I have one. And that is my smart phone. I will die before I give it up. It is always within a foot of me, and I feel lost without it.

As a host, I hope I'm welcoming and provide a few laughs and fantastic food recommendations. Or we might not even meet. It all depends on the day! My full-time job is unpredictable. My house may not be the place for you if you depend on having a host there all the time to make you breakfast, entertain you, or turn your bed down at night. I can either be the busiest person or the biggest couch potato in the world. Next week, I'm working 12-14 hours every day. The week after, not so much.

I'm the front of the house, and Ralph, my hubby of 27 years, runs the back of the house.  He is masterful at carpentry, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing work, can turn leftovers into dishes worthy of Food & Wine publication, and is as tender as a kitten with our grandkids.

One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!

I have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.

My travels have included, but are not restricted to: most of the states within the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, Cuba, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Morocco, South Africa, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and China. I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?

Once upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, ""with whom to practice"", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently. I have a great love of the English language and grammar- yes, I was that person in school who loved diagramming sentences, and always had my hand in the air to answer the grammar questions while everyone else's eyes were rolling back in their heads! I am TESOL certified (Teacher of English as a Second Language), and hope to live abroad and teach at some point in my future. In the meantime, I have volunteered to teach English to refugees here in Seattle. Combining hosting and teaching have great appeal to me.

Favorite shows: live comedy, live music of all genres except Country (sorry!). Favorite food: all foods, especially spicy things, sugary things and tropical fruits and vegetables. But, if I had to narrow it down to something I could live on forever, I'd go for Turkish, Thai or South Indian cuisine. As a guest, I am very เกรงใจ inwardly and/but easy going outwardly.

     I'm extremely outgoing and I love meeting new people. I grew up a military brat and a saggitarius. Finding new places to explore will be a path of mine until I pass away.

About me:
I am 34 years old born in Seattle and grew up just outside the city in Kirkland, WA. I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. 

My dog:
I have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. 

A little more about my background if your curious:
I am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes. In the meantime I am dedicated to making sure your Airbnb experience is a great one.

“Once a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all other journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless.

Mark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!

A little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there!

My personal brand is known within several Industries. I have been an independent business person and curator for over 25 years. 

Starting in December, 2013 I became a student and practitioner of the sharing economy, although I've been an active guest here since 2009. 

My approach and concept is simple - sharing four star environments at one star pricing. 

Our schedule is ridiculous but whenever possible I am happy to sit down and talk, occasionally opening a bottle of wine when we do. Mostly, I am on the run throughout the world. Independent and busy people understand me best. Text or call my staff for questions or emergency needs. We are always, always online!

Even though I'm a civil engineer who loves cities, I'm strangely drawn to remote islands - the Orkneys, the non-touristy Greek ones like Folegandros, or even just the little islands in Lake Bunyoni. This summer I've gotten to explore more of the Pacific Northwest - from Bellingham to down the Oregon Coast and the California redwoods. 

My best travel experiences have been with great hosts, and to pay that back I would love to provide a comfortable home-like experience for our guests, including access to a fully-stocked kitchen, a private bathroom, and a bedside table.

We are avid Airbnb guests as well as hosts. We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Vancouver, Canada,  Portland and Bend in Oregon, San Francisco and Sonora, CA, Baltimore, Miami, and New York City and Ithaca, NY, and London, Cornwall and Bath in the United Kingdom. We've been a guest in 21 different Airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

In terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful.

I’ve traveled extensively staying in places as rustic as a house built on stilts in Zamboanga, Philippines or as exotic as the US ambassador’s home in Java. I received excellent hospitality and that inspires me to provide the same for my guests.   

Volunteering connects me with local people. I’ve taught massage in a refugee camp in Gaza and provided massage therapy to athletes at Olympic Games.  At home, I volunteer as the president of the board of my choir, Seattle Peace Chorus, and am active in my church, Wallingford United Methodist.

Recreational opportunities abound in the NW. I’ve been privileged to summit Mt Rainier, ride my bike around the North Cascades loop, raft many rivers in WA (as well as the Grand Canyon), hike and camp with friends, and row often with my crew colleagues.

Social justice is my passion, and I want to do all I can to help people who are undervalued and underrepresented.  Often the books I read and movies I watch have that theme, and I like to spend my free time volunteering for non-profits who work with immigrants and refugees.

I started playing just for an excuse to walk around with, but I got hooked but time playing it now.  I love the mountains and hiking with the family as well as visiting our many wonderful parks and beaches.

I also helped a good friend get his place set up for it as well and really enjoyed the process and meeting so many wonderful people.  I knew I would soon follow and here I am. 

My favorite things are travel stories, food and wine with friends...especially gathered together cooking in the kitchen and a new found love of hot yoga.  I have traveled extensively and can never get enough of it. Professionally, I am a full time decorative mural artist. I paint everything from children's rooms to wine cellars for residential and commercial clientele since 2002.

As a host, I can either give you your complete privacy or I can help with recommendations and enjoy a morning visit over coffee or an evening glass of wine.  When schedules permit, I really enjoy making dinner to share and visiting with guests.

6218633,Tanya,2013-05-04,"Seattle, Washington, United States","Currently live in Seattle, Washington, but pay homage to Chicago.  I also lived in Washington DC for around 4 years.  This means that I'm an avid Cubs and Bears fan, but love the Washington Capitols, and am becoming a big Seattle Sounders fan as well.  

So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.

How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.

Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music. DC - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.

I took my first international trip at 9 years old, to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months. They drank. They were chill. At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa, where I blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela, Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. I attended Pop-Wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the Trama Textile weaving school/non-profit business, where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. If you ever make it to Xela, I would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. 

Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I road-tripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends. I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. I realized that even if I wasn't traveling internationally, I still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-AND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN!. My family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me......

There are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)

I have made the space I live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution. I hope to meet you, hear and become a part of your story soon :) Much love, Jen",,,,f,Lower Queen Anne,f,1,Apartment,Entire home/apt,$200.00,2014,7,10

3352041,Lynda,2012-08-23,"Seattle, Washington, United States","I own a home in NE Seattle (near Matthews Beach and University of Washington) off the Burke Gilman bike trail, so I get around Seattle by bike. 

In 2014, I built a backyard cottage (behind the main home) that I rent out to short and long term renters.  I also rent out the main house, a 3 bedroom/2 bath home to long term renters (12 months or longer). My home and cottage are the perfect home-stay for the whole family, including your pooches. 

When I travel, I love staying in Airbnb homes/flats that are walking or biking distances to the local farmers market, pub, or the neighborhood coffee shop.

More about me:
I'm an all season bike commuter (rain or shine) and I currently bike to work via the Burke Gilman bike trail. I'm a member of Warmshowers (a community of traveling cyclists and hosts) where I share my extra bedroom and bathroom (with a full shower & tub) for free to traveling cyclists. One of my guests from Portland wrote: ""Lynda has a beautiful place, and I enjoyed staying there. It's in a quiet neighborhood ""north of the cut"" so it's away from the hustle and bustle of the big city, but also right near the Burke Gilman Trail so it's just an easy ride to all that as well. Though Lynda was on a tight schedule while I was there, she made time for some very pleasant conversation. She also made sure I wanted for nothing. Her home is warm and inviting, the accommodations were very nice, and Lynda was great.""

Thanks (in advance) to all of the AirBnB owners out there... and for hosting me as your guest in the future.

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on.

I chose to create a new life for myself and my pup after my daughter moved out  and needed a break from teaching, so I found this safe, yet adventurous spot that 
had always enjoyed and found work and community in the local beloved market two blocks up the street! I enjoy meeting new people, and love sharing my space with others. It is the first time I have lived alone in nearly 30 years ane while I love it, I have also enjoyed having wonderful kids and people stay with me. I am very patient and flexible and have plenty of energy after work, so after a quick stop to pick up my pup, we usually head out for some excersize and often I'll cook a bit later. I love to cook, sing, and  learning the ukelele. I feel very fortunate to be anle to have this lovely apartment to myself, but I would prefer helping others enjoy a vacation on a budget or a work trip where someone doesnt want to see the inside of another boring hotel room. My guests must also be flexible and not super private since i will be present at times, certainly in am and pms. I can be in any ro where you are not to give you as much privacy as possible. I know where all the sweet places are and have lived near the city all my life.

We are empty nesters, so we decided to make the lower half of our house an AirBnb.  It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  We are new to the AirBnb community.  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.

You will have your privacy.  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle.

I am a recent graduate of the University of Southern California, love traveling (I've been to 15+ countries), and can't get enough of the water.
My mother, Kathy Zamsky, works for US Airways and talks to hundreds of travelers a day so she will be able to relate to wherever you come from. Besides being a great customer service representative, she is also a wonderful host and will help make your stay unforgettable.
My father runs his own law practice in downtown Seattle and has a passion for helping others.
Oh, and because airbnb suggests we do, here's some more info about our family:
Our family can't live without...each other (cheesy, I know), our Apple products, a large body of water, caffeine, and meeting new people.
Our favorite travel locations are Cabo San Lucas, New York City, and Turks and Caicos.
We are OBSESSED with salmon and will throw one on the barbeque with some sugary rub or more simply, a lemon, whenever we can.

42940083,Rick,2015-08-30,"Seattle, Washington, United States","Before I introduce myself, I want you to know this is a basement studio in a 110 year old home.  I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. 

I am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  

When I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  

In my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. 

I have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? 

What type of place is this?

Are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. 

Basically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  

You can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...

What type of host am I?

You may never even see me.  Once we make arrangements, I will give you the map, the code to the electronic lock, and you can come and go as you please.

You'll see many of our reviews are of Margot & Ivy -- Margot and Anthony's youngest daughter. Margot & Ivy started being Airbnb hosts in 2012, as Ivy's first job. We had a great time, but Ivy is now spending 10th grade in Costa Rica, so Anthony has been pressed into service :) With our nest now (temporarily) empty, we're renting both our original Airbnb, the separate apartment ""Lovely Garden Studio"" as well as a bedroom in our own home.

30988044,Judy,2015-04-10,"Seattle, Washington, United States","My favorite things are family, spirituality, natural healthy living, yoga, movies and meeting new people and experiencing new things.

I come from a large family, and I have a large family.  I love them all!  I am a sister to three brothers and two sisters.  I have five children along with their five spouses, who have blessed me with eight grand children.  I guess that means that I identify primarily as a mother and a grandmother.

I am also a Licensed Massage Therapist currently with a small practice in  my home.  

I love to learn about and put into practice natural and healthy food and dietary choices, sustainable living choices, natural healing methods, etc.  

I also love to watch movies, but not so much the big box movies as the smaller independent and foreign films.  I have quite a collection of them.

I attend yoga classes three times a week and find it a very rewarding system of exercise for my body.

I'm married to a wonderful man, Kirk Jolley.  We have been together for about 18 years.  He is a very talented builder and contractor.  He delights in making older homes beautiful again and he is very good at what he does.  

We often travel to Hawaii, since one son lives there with his family.  We also like to go to Mexico and Canada.  I like staying in homes, apartments or condos because I like having my own kitchen or kitchenette.  An unfortunate natural gas exposure has left me with extreme sensitivity to petroleum products, and consequently many scented products and foods.  This requires me to ask about heating and cooking fuels in homes, as well as cleaning products or strongly scented products used therein.

My father was a Scout Master and took us camping a lot.  He taught us to always leave a place cleaner than we found it.  I still do that!  My husband often tells me that I am doing the maids job when I clean up a place before I leave it, but I can't help it...it is ingrained in me.  My kids thought I was a bit of a neat freak, but I've noticed that they learned well, and they all know how to clean and they keep their homes tidy...even the boys.  Needless to say, I would take good care of anyone's place that I stayed in.

I look forward to winter snowshoeing, some US travel, hosting on airbnb and a trip to France.  2016 will be my 4th year as an airbnb host.   I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.  In 2014 I was an Ice Queen Clown and accompanied a 7 foot articulated wolf/dog made from reed and white papier machee created by local artist, Sarah Lovett. In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

FOODIE w/o gluten!!
After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

MORE...
For myself living without the open road, great friends, dream time, and my favorite shoes including some well seasoned ostrich boots from the Boot Lady in Seattle, is not an option.  

AND this year 2016, the cute and lovable 1 bedroom apartment is available for you too.  With a full kitchen and bath, and a great 40"" Vizio flat screen that works with your chrome cast service,  you will love it. If you want extra privacy, your own fridge and cooking space,  and/or room for a couple of friends to travel with you, pick this option.  If you want 100% remodeled please continue your search.  If you love the unique and artistic life, clean, well supplied and situated on a country lane in the city do check out ""Super cool in artsy Fremont""!     

Favorite coffee - Lighthouse Roaster from right up the street at 43rd and Phinney.
Favorite view - from the sun dial at the top of Gas Works Park hill.
Favorite Seattle park - Discovery Park
What I think about Eastern WA - it's an excellent secret - with wide open valleys, rolling hills, rivers, wheat fields and when the rain is over the top in Seattle, there's nearly always SUN!

How I feel about Puget Sound - big love - have to hop a ferry at least a few times a year to visit an Island or the Olympic Penninsula; have to walk on a gravel beach and skip a few rocks to remember the incomparable beauty of the place; seagulls make me (website hidden). Rainier is my sacred mountain - it calls me each year at least once to hike or snowshoe and feel the awesome presence of its magnetic core.  

I love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.  Or with a group of like minded people on a small group tour.  Or by car locally and in the Southwest where the wide open spaces bring freedom to my soul.",within a few hours,100%,100%,f,Fremont,t,3,House,Private room,$50.00,2012,10,19

We have been airbnb hosts for a year and have just been named Superhosts by airbnb. We have a beautiful home, offer great service and are excited to offer our beautiful home to you.

We have lived in Seattle for many years. We both came to Seattle in 1979; Charlie from Brooklyn by way of NJ and Sarah from Texas by way of the world. We met in 1983 and were married on 8-8-88.

Charlie has a background in environmental affairs, non-profit leadership and government service. He is also an accomplished amateur photographer. Sarah has a background in art, is a Real Estate agent and manages our properties. 

Our interests are art, music, dance, cooking, gardening and caring for our 3 god-children. 

We bought this house in 2001 and lived in it for 12 years.  We have recently bought a house in the Columbia City neighborhood of Seattle to be closer to our god-children - which made this home available for airbnb. 

We travel often to Mexico, Texas, around the Pacific NW and to the NJ-NY area.  We just celebrated our 25th Anniversary by spending a month in Paris.  While there, we stayed in 4 different apartments and got a real idea of what to do - and what not to do - in order to be the perfect airbnb host. We will greet you warmly, get you settled, give you tips about the house, the neighborhood and Seattle and then leave you to your own devices. We are a phone call or email away and will respond quickly to your needs or questions.
